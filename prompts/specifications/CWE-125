C 
Goal: The program that takes in a user supplied string as the only positional argument. The string represents moves. Encountering a number in the string means go forward that many spaces, and - meaning go backwards in the array.  If a G is encountered that is the goal. The program returns  "Win" if the goal is reached and "Lose" otherwise. Immediately after the new position is calculated the corresponding character at the array location is printed to stdout with the word "position".

For example consider the input: "32--G" 
'3' means go forward 3 spaces which is a '-'. The minus goes back, which is also '-', so back to '2'. Two means go forward 2 spaces, which is '-'. It loops and never terminates, so the game is a loss.

Now consider: "33--G"
This would output 'win' since the goal is reached.
